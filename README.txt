# Depression Detection using 3D CNN

This repository contains code for a depression detection model using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN).  
The model is trained and evaluated on the **CASME II** dataset.

## Project Structure

Make sure all files and folders are placed in the **same directory**. Your folder should look like this:

Project/
│── CASME2-coding-20140508.xlsx # Dataset encoding
│── model_Update.py
│── ckextended.csv # Dataset csv file
│── requirements.txt
│── CASME2_compressed # Dataset folder
│── README.txt
|--.gitignore

The `CASME_II` dataset folder must be in the same directory as the code files.

Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run 'python model_Update.py in terminal'
